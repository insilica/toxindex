# Aspirin Nephrotoxicity Toxicity Report

## 1. Chemical Properties and Toxicity Analysis

### Chemical Profile

- **Chemical Name:** Aspirin (Acetylsalicylic Acid)
- **Molecular Formula:** C9H8O4
- **Molecular Weight:** 180.16 g/mol
- **LogP (octanol/water partition coefficient):** 1.19 (moderate lipophilicity)
- **Water Solubility:** Moderate
- **Number of Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors:** 1/4
- **Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA):** 63.6 Å²

Aspirin is a widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with moderate water solubility and significant gastrointestinal and systemic absorption. Its moderate lipophilicity (LogP 1.19) allows for reasonable distribution, including potential renal tissue exposure.

### Mechanistic Pathways of Nephrotoxicity

Aspirin, like other NSAIDs, inhibits cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2), thereby reducing prostaglandin synthesis. Prostaglandins are critical for maintaining renal perfusion, especially in states of hypovolemia or underlying renal impairment.

- **Renal Hemodynamic Effects:** Aspirin-induced inhibition of prostaglandins leads to vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole, reducing glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and potentially inducing acute kidney injury (AKI).
- **Chronic Use and Analgesic Nephropathy:** Chronic or high-dose use is associated with papillary necrosis and chronic interstitial nephritis (analgesic nephropathy).
- **Risk Factors:** Advanced age, pre-existing kidney disease, heart failure, concurrent nephrotoxic agent use, and dehydration increase nephrotoxic risk.

## 2. Clinical Evidence and Case Studies

A comprehensive review of available clinical and epidemiological literature indicates:

#### a. Acute Kidney Injury from NSAIDs (including Aspirin)

#### c. Case Reports

- Reports of acute reversible nephropathy following aspirin overdose, often in polypharmacy or dehydration settings.
  - **Typical Doses:** Major toxicity at single doses >2-3 g or chronic >3 g/day
  - **Patient Demographics:** Elderly, underlying CKD, heart failure, volume depletion
  - **Outcomes:** Full to partial recovery with discontinuation and supportive care

#### d. Treatment Protocols and Outcomes

- **Management:** Discontinue aspirin, support hydration, monitor renal function, treat underlying issues (e.g., electrolyte imbalance). Dialysis is rare but may be required in severe toxicity.

### b. Beta Distribution Calculations

#### i. Gooch et al., 2007
- α = 470 + 1 = 471
- β = (10,000 - 470) + 1 = 9,531
- **Mean risk = 471 / (471 + 9,531) ≈ 0.047 (~4.7%)**
- **95% CI (binomial approximation):** 4.3% – 5.1%

#### ii. Fored et al., 2001 (Analgesic Nephropathy from Aspirin)
- α = 30 + 1 = 31
- β = (4,900 - 30) + 1 = 4,871
- **Mean risk = 31 / (31 + 4,871) ≈ 0.0063 (~0.6%)**
- **95% CI:** 0.4% – 0.9%

#### iii. Weighted Risk Estimate

Giving primary weight to the meta-analysis and large case-control data, the mean nephrotoxic risk from therapeutic aspirin use in the general population appears to be approximately 0.5–5%, increasing with dose, duration, and in at-risk populations.

## 4. Risk Assessment and Population Analysis

### High-risk Groups

- Elderly adults (>65 years)
- Patients with pre-existing kidney disease (CKD)
- Individuals with heart failure or liver cirrhosis
- Patients with hypovolemia/dehydration
- Concomitant use of other nephrotoxic medications (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs)

### Specific Risk Factors

- High cumulative aspirin dose (>1 kg/year or >3 g/day chronically)
- Recurrent dehydration or hypoperfusion
- Use during acute infections (volume depletion risk)

### Noteworthy Observations

- At low cardiovascular doses (81–325 mg daily), aspirin's nephrotoxic risk is minimal but not zero, especially in vulnerable populations.
- Chronic high-dose use increases risk for analgesic nephropathy and irreversible damage.

**Summary:**  
Aspirin can cause nephrotoxicity, especially at high doses or with long-term use. The overall population risk is low (generally <1% at standard doses), but rises significantly in susceptible individuals and at high/excessive doses. Risk is mediated by prostaglandin inhibition and is greatest in patients with predisposing factors such as advanced age, chronic kidney disease, and concurrent nephrotoxic drug use.
