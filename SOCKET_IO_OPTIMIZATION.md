# Socket.IO Optimization Changes

## Problem Analysis

Your web app was experiencing excessive Socket.IO polling with both 400 and 200 status codes due to:

1. **Multiple Socket.IO Instances**: Separate connections in Dashboard and ChatSession components
2. **Authentication Issues**: 400 errors from failed authentication when joining rooms
3. **Inefficient Room Management**: Constant joining/leaving rooms based on state changes
4. **Missing Error Handling**: No proper handling of connection failures

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Shared Socket Context (`frontend/src/context/SocketContext.tsx`)
- Single Socket.IO connection shared across all components
- Proper connection state management
- Optimized reconnection settings

### 2. Updated Dashboard Component (`frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx`)
- Uses shared socket from context instead of creating its own
- Added connection state checks before room operations
- Improved error handling and logging
- Reduced unnecessary reconnections

### 3. Updated ChatSession Component (`frontend/src/components/ChatSession.tsx`)
- Uses shared socket from context
- Added connection state checks
- Improved error handling

### 4. Updated App Component (`frontend/src/App.tsx`)
- Wrapped app with SocketProvider to provide shared socket

### 5. Optimized Server Configuration (`webserver/socketio.py`)
- Added ping timeout and interval settings
- Optimized buffer size and async mode

### 6. Enhanced Server Handlers (`webserver/app.py`)
- Added better error handling and logging
- Added authentication checks for chat sessions
- Added disconnect handler
- Removed duplicate handler from chat controller

## Expected Improvements

1. **Reduced Polling**: Single connection instead of multiple
2. **Fewer 400 Errors**: Better authentication handling
3. **Better Performance**: Optimized server settings
4. **Improved Debugging**: Enhanced logging and error handling

## Testing

To test the changes:

1. **Check Network Tab**: Should see fewer Socket.IO requests
2. **Monitor Console**: Look for connection logs and reduced error messages
3. **Test Authentication**: Ensure users can still join rooms properly
4. **Check Performance**: Polling frequency should be reduced

## Monitoring

Watch for these logs:
- `[SocketIO] Connected` - Successful connections
- `[SocketIO] Connection error` - Connection failures
- `[socketio] join_task_room called with data` - Room join attempts
- `[socketio] join_chat_session called with data` - Chat room joins

## Troubleshooting

If you still see excessive polling:
1. Check if multiple components are still creating their own sockets
2. Verify the SocketProvider is wrapping the entire app
3. Check server logs for authentication errors
4. Ensure Redis is running properly for Socket.IO clustering
