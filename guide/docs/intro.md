# Welcome to ToxIndex

ToxIndex helps you analyze and interpret chemical toxicity using AI-assisted workflows. This guide walks you through getting started, running workflows, and understanding results.

## Getting started

1. Open the app at `toxindex.com` and sign in.
2. Choose an environment from the top selector.
3. Pick a workflow and provide inputs (text or file as required).
4. Submit the task and monitor progress on the dashboard.

## Core workflows

- RAP: Rapid assessment pipeline for toxicity narratives.
- MetaboliteSygma: Predicts likely metabolites and transformations.
- Ranking: Ranks candidates by toxicity-relevant criteria.
- Heatmap: Visual overview of model scores across candidates.
- Pathway: Maps entities to biological pathways.

See the detailed pages in the sidebar for inputs, outputs, and examples.

## Uploads and files

- Some workflows require a file. Use the file picker when prompted.
- Supported formats typically include CSV, TXT, and JSON. See workflow pages for specifics.

## Reading results

- Each task shows status and duration; click a finished task to view details.
- Downloadable artifacts (tables, images) appear in the task view when available.

## Troubleshooting

- Stuck or long‑running tasks: tasks time out automatically; try resubmitting with smaller inputs.
- Errors on upload: check file format and column names; see the workflow’s example.
- Need help: open an issue on GitHub or contact support.

Next: explore a workflow to begin.
