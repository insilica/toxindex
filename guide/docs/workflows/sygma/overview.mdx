# SyGMA Workflow Overview

The Systematic Generation of potential Metabolites (SyGMA) workflow uses systematic generation of potential metabolites to answer questions about chemical metabolism. This workflow helps researchers understand how chemicals are transformed in biological systems.

## What is SyGMA?

SyGMA (Systematic Generation of potential Metabolites) is a computational approach that systematically generates potential metabolites of chemicals through various metabolic pathways. It provides insights into chemical transformation processes and metabolite formation.

## Key Features

- **Systematic Metabolite Generation**: Comprehensive generation of potential metabolites
- **Multiple Metabolic Pathways**: Support for various metabolic transformation rules
- **Metabolite Prioritization**: Ranking of metabolites by likelihood and importance
- **Structure-Activity Relationships**: Analysis of metabolite properties and activities
- **Visualization Tools**: Interactive metabolic pathway diagrams

## Use Cases

- **Drug Metabolism**: Understanding drug transformation and clearance
- **Toxicology Assessment**: Identifying potentially toxic metabolites
- **Environmental Fate**: Predicting chemical transformation in the environment
- **Metabolic Engineering**: Designing metabolic pathways for biotechnology
- **Regulatory Assessment**: Supporting regulatory decision-making

## Workflow Process

1. **Input Preparation**: Upload chemical structures and select metabolic pathways
2. **Metabolite Generation**: Systematic generation of potential metabolites
3. **Metabolite Analysis**: Property prediction and activity assessment
4. **Pathway Visualization**: Interactive metabolic pathway diagrams
5. **Result Export**: Download metabolites and pathway data
