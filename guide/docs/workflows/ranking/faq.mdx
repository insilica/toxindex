# Ranking Workflow FAQ

## General Questions

### What is the Ranking workflow used for?

The Ranking workflow enables pairwise comparison of chemicals to generate quantitative rankings based on toxicity endpoints. It's useful for regulatory prioritization, research planning, and risk assessment.

### How many chemicals can I rank at once?

The system supports ranking of 2-100 chemicals in a single analysis. For larger chemical sets, consider breaking them into smaller groups or using hierarchical ranking approaches.

### What types of endpoints can I use for ranking?

You can use various toxicity endpoints including:
- Acute toxicity (LD50, LC50)
- Chronic toxicity (NOAEL, LOAEL)
- Organ-specific toxicity
- Environmental endpoints
- Custom endpoints from your data

## Technical Questions

### What ranking algorithms are available?

The system supports multiple ranking algorithms:
- **Bradley-Terry Model**: For pairwise comparison data
- **Thurstone Model**: For continuous endpoint data
- **Borda Count**: For multiple endpoint aggregation
- **Custom Algorithms**: For specialized ranking needs

### How are confidence intervals calculated?

Confidence intervals are calculated using bootstrap resampling and Bayesian methods, providing uncertainty estimates for ranking positions.

### Can I rank chemicals with missing endpoint data?

Yes, the system handles missing data using:
- Imputation methods for missing values
- Weighted ranking based on data availability
- Sensitivity analysis for missing data impact

## Data Questions

### What chemical identifiers are supported?

Supported identifiers include:
- SMILES strings
- CAS numbers
- Chemical names
- InChI keys
- PubChem IDs

### How do I handle conflicting endpoint data?

The system provides several approaches:
- **Weighted Averaging**: Based on data quality and source reliability
- **Consensus Methods**: Multiple data sources for the same endpoint
- **Expert Weighting**: Manual assignment of endpoint importance
- **Statistical Aggregation**: Robust statistical methods for data integration

### Can I use my own endpoint data?

Yes, you can upload custom endpoint data in CSV format. The system will integrate your data with existing ToxIndex endpoints.

## Results Questions

### How do I interpret ranking results?

- **Ranking Position**: Lower numbers indicate higher priority/toxicity
- **Confidence Intervals**: Wider intervals indicate more uncertainty
- **Statistical Significance**: P-values indicate ranking reliability
- **Endpoint Contributions**: Shows which endpoints drive the ranking

### Can I export ranking results?

Yes, you can export:
- CSV files with ranking data
- PDF reports with visualizations
- Raw pairwise comparison data
- Statistical analysis results

### How do I validate ranking results?

Validation approaches include:
- Cross-validation with known chemical rankings
- Sensitivity analysis with different endpoint weights
- Comparison with literature-based rankings
- Expert review of ranking positions

## Troubleshooting

### Why did my ranking analysis fail?

Common causes include:
- Invalid chemical identifiers
- Insufficient endpoint data
- Conflicting endpoint values
- System resource limitations

### How do I improve ranking quality?

- Use high-quality, consistent endpoint data
- Select relevant endpoints for your ranking goals
- Consider endpoint weighting based on importance
- Validate results with known chemical properties

### Can I modify ranking parameters after starting?

No, ranking parameters cannot be modified once the analysis starts. You'll need to start a new analysis with different parameters.

## Advanced Usage

### Can I create custom ranking criteria?

Yes, you can define custom ranking criteria including:
- Endpoint-specific weighting
- Custom aggregation functions
- Domain-specific ranking rules
- Regulatory compliance criteria

### How do I handle ties in rankings?

The system provides several tie-breaking methods:
- Secondary endpoint criteria
- Data quality scores
- Random assignment
- Manual tie-breaking

### Can I rank chemicals across different domains?

Yes, the system supports cross-domain ranking using:
- Normalized endpoint scores
- Domain-specific weighting
- Multi-criteria decision analysis
- Hierarchical ranking approaches
