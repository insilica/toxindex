# Getting Started with Ranking

This guide will walk you through using the Ranking workflow to compare and rank chemicals based on their toxicity profiles.

## Step 1: Access the Ranking Workflow

1. Navigate to the **Workflows** section in your ToxIndex dashboard
2. Click on **Ranking** to open the ranking interface
3. You'll see the ranking setup page with options for chemical selection and endpoint configuration

## Step 2: Select Chemicals for Ranking

### Option A: Upload Chemical List
1. Click **Upload Chemical List**
2. Upload a CSV file with chemical identifiers (SMILES, CAS numbers, or names)
3. Verify the chemicals are correctly parsed

### Option B: Select from Environment
1. Click **Select from Environment**
2. Choose chemicals from your existing environments
3. Select the specific chemicals you want to rank

## Step 3: Configure Endpoints

1. **Choose Endpoint Categories**:
   - Acute toxicity endpoints
   - Chronic toxicity endpoints
   - Specific organ toxicity
   - Environmental endpoints

2. **Select Specific Endpoints**:
   - Browse available endpoints for your selected categories
   - Choose endpoints relevant to your ranking criteria

3. **Set Ranking Parameters**:
   - Define ranking criteria (higher/lower values are better)
   - Set confidence levels for statistical analysis
   - Choose ranking algorithm (Bradley-Terry, Thurstone, etc.)

## Step 4: Run the Ranking Analysis

1. Click **Start Ranking Analysis**
2. Monitor the progress in the task queue
3. The system will perform pairwise comparisons and generate rankings

## Step 5: Review Results

### Ranking Results
- **Overall Rankings**: Numerical rankings with confidence intervals
- **Pairwise Comparisons**: Detailed comparison matrices
- **Statistical Significance**: P-values and confidence levels
- **Endpoint Contributions**: How each endpoint contributes to the final ranking

### Visualization Options
- **Ranking Charts**: Bar charts showing relative rankings
- **Comparison Networks**: Network diagrams of pairwise comparisons
- **Endpoint Heatmaps**: Heatmaps showing endpoint-specific rankings
- **Statistical Plots**: Confidence intervals and significance testing

## Step 6: Export and Save Results

1. **Download Rankings**: Export CSV files with ranking data
2. **Save to Environment**: Store results in your environment for future reference
3. **Generate Reports**: Create PDF reports with ranking summaries
4. **Share Results**: Share ranking results with collaborators

## Tips for Success

- **Start Small**: Begin with 5-10 chemicals to understand the workflow
- **Choose Relevant Endpoints**: Select endpoints that align with your ranking goals
- **Review Statistical Output**: Pay attention to confidence intervals and significance levels
- **Validate Results**: Cross-check rankings with known chemical properties

- Review the [Technical Architecture](/docs/workflows/ranking/architecture)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Chemical Identifiers**: Ensure all chemicals are properly identified
2. **Verify Endpoint Selection**: Make sure you've selected at least one endpoint
3. **Review Error Messages**: Check the task details for specific error information
4. **Contact Support**: Reach out if you need assistance with the ranking workflow
