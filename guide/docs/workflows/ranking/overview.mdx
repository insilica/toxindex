# Ranking Workflow Overview

The Ranking workflow enables pairwise comparison of chemical endpoints to rank chemicals based on their toxicity profiles. This workflow helps researchers prioritize chemicals for further study or regulatory consideration.

## What is Chemical Ranking?

Chemical ranking is a systematic approach to ordering chemicals based on their relative toxicity or other endpoints. The ranking workflow uses pairwise comparisons to establish relative rankings between chemicals, providing a quantitative basis for decision-making.

## Key Features

- **Pairwise Comparisons**: Compare chemicals head-to-head across multiple endpoints
- **Quantitative Rankings**: Generate numerical rankings with confidence intervals
- **Multiple Endpoints**: Support for various toxicity endpoints and assays
- **Statistical Analysis**: Built-in statistical methods for robust ranking
- **Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs for ranking results

## Use Cases

- **Regulatory Prioritization**: Rank chemicals for regulatory attention
- **Research Planning**: Identify high-priority chemicals for detailed study
- **Risk Assessment**: Support risk-based chemical management decisions
- **Literature Mining**: Rank chemicals based on available toxicity data

## Workflow Process

1. **Input Selection**: Choose chemicals and endpoints for comparison
2. **Pairwise Analysis**: System performs pairwise comparisons
3. **Ranking Generation**: Statistical ranking algorithms generate final rankings
4. **Result Visualization**: Interactive charts display ranking results
5. **Export Options**: Download rankings and supporting data
