# Outputs and Artifacts

RAP produces two kinds of outputs: inline messages to the UI and downloadable files stored in GCS.

## Inline message

After generation, RAP sends the Markdown report as a chat/task message:

- The content is human-readable Markdown converted from the structured assessment
- Emitted to both the task room and the chat session room (if any)

## Downloadable artifacts (GCS)

RAP writes two files per task under `tasks/<task_id>/` in your configured GCS bucket:

- `probra_result_<uuid>.json`: structured JSON result
- `probra_result_<uuid>.md`: Markdown report

These are uploaded via the platform storage layer and announced back to the UI as `task_file` events with:

- `filename`: the object name
- `filepath`: the GCS path
- `file_type`: `json` or `markdown`
- `content_type`: `application/json` or `text/markdown`

You can download these artifacts from the task details view.
