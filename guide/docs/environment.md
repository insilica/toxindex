# Environments

Environments in ToxIndex provide separation of input and output files, ensuring different users have appropriate levels of access to files and workflows.

## What are environments?

Environments act as isolated workspaces where:
- Project admins have access to all environments and their associated files
- Users can upload files from their computer to share with other users in the same environment
- Files and workflow results are organized and secured by environment

## File uploads

You can upload files directly to your environment for processing with various workflows.

### Upload interface

## Environment access levels

- **Project Admin**: Full access to all environments and their files
- **Environment Member**: Access to files within their assigned environments
- **File Sharing**: Files uploaded to an environment are accessible to all users in that environment

## Best practices

- Organize files by project or team using different environments
- Use descriptive environment names for easy identification
- Upload files in supported formats for your chosen workflows
